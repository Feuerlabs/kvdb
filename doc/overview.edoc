%% kvdb -- Key-Value Database
%%
%% A light-weight database API supporting some different backends
%% (currently `sqlite3' and `leveldb').
%%
%% kvdb supports the concept of databases, where each database has a number of tables.
%% Objects are always stored as either `{Key, Value}' or `{Key, Attributes, Value}',
%% depending on how the database and table are configured.
